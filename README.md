# üí£ Minesweeper-AI
A passion project featuring a custom-built Minesweeper clone in **C# (WinForms)** and a **Python-based** rule-driven solver. The solver uses traditional AI techniques based on classic Minesweeper patterns ([minesweeper.online/help/patterns](minesweeper.online/help/patterns)) and interacts with the game through screen recognition and automation via `pyautogui` and `OpenCV`.

- **ruleSolver.py** ‚Äì Script to solve Minesweeper puzzles üë®‚Äçüè´
- **sweeperLib.py** ‚Äì Module encapsulating screenshotting, mapping screenshots to minefield data structures, uncovering & flagging tiles üß∞


All custom assets created for this project ‚Äî namely the **"dark-mode" Minesweeper tiles** and **7-segment display images** which were drawn using Aseprite ‚Äî are released under the **MIT License** and are free for anyone to use, modify, or redistribute. All other assets used in the project were sourced from the public domain.

# üìà Future Plans (Not in Order of Importance)
[0] -> Make camelCase and snake_case consistent throughout program

[1] -> Implement "remaining mines" and "timer" 7-segment displays to minesweeper game

[2] -> Improve solver success rate (add remainder of patterns, certain patterns require knowledge of the remaining mines)

[3] -> Benchmark performance and compare against other algorithms, consider potential optimisations and improvements

[4] -> Produce project overview video

[5] -> Create a _new solver_ using **ML techniques** (genetic algorithms / neural networks)

[6] -> REPLACEMENTS OF BOTTOM BLUE BAR OF SCREEN: Include visualisation of frontier into program, potentially "random seed" or "set seed" button, display current seed.

[7] -> UI improvements, fix button animations and improve menu screen because it's currently a bit ugly

[8] -> Refactor minefield data structure to avoid clicking uncovered tiles multiple times (slow)

# ‚úÖ Acknowledgements
While this project is entirely my own work, I used generative AI tools in a limited and intentional way to support my learning process. Specifically:

- ChatGPT (GPT-4.5, OpenAI ‚Äì https://chat.openai.com/) was used primarily for debugging support, summarising notes, and proofreading text I had already written. I avoided relying on it for code generation to ensure I developed a deep understanding of the technologies and problem-solving approaches involved.

- GitHub Copilot was occasionally used to assist with syntax or auto-completion, but not for generating core logic or algorithms. (Only used for game code, not solver)

My goal was to minimise reliance on generative AI in order to better learn and internalise the principles behind both traditional AI methods and system development.
